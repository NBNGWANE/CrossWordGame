# CrossWordGame
A crossword game  is a very friendly game that I created. U need Codeblocks to run it and it very easy to follow it

Basically, u will be asked questions related to covid-19 and u will have to provide one word answer and when u get the answer right then your correct answer will be displayed on the grid and then the score will increase if u got the answer right.

For example the first answer for question1 is “Nasal” and then “Nasal” will appear on the grid and then the second answer for question2 is “Anosmia” and then “Anosmia” will appear on the grid and your score will be 2 because u got 2 answers correct and so on and so on. If u get the answer wrong, u will have to repeat that question until u get the correct answer and  then when u finish level one, u then play level 2 which has difficult questions than level one
